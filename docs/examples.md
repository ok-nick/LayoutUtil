# Examples

LayoutUtil was designed for easy use with no worries. All you have to do is require the module and construct the class with the desired UILayout as a parameter. There are more advanced features available which are listed within the API if necessary.
```lua
local LayoutUtil = require(PATH) -- define the path to the module

LayoutUtil.new(UILAYOUT) -- define the path to the UILayout
```
